# Box Drawing Application

## The Brief

Your team is looking for a change of pace from the usual projects. This time, the goal is to create a Box Drawing Application! This app will allow users to draw boxes of various sizes.

## The Rules

To ensure high-quality code, your team has decided to apply Tests. Each feature must be thoroughly tested before moving on to the next.

This project is designed as an incremental kata to mirror real-world development processes. Work through each requirement in sequence, and avoid looking ahead to future requirements until the current one is complete.

## The Backlog

- Basic Box Drawing: The application should be able to draw a basic 2x2 box.
Test Case: Drawing a 2x2 box should result in a specific box structure with borders and empty space inside.
- Variable Size Box Drawing: The application should also support drawing boxes of different sizes.
Test Case: Drawing a 6x3 box should result in a larger box structure with appropriate dimensions.

## The following jest scenarios are provided to guide the development:

.drawBox Functionality:
- Test 1: Should draw a 2x2 box.
The expected result is a string representing a 2x2 box.
- Test 2: Should draw a 6x3 box.
The expected result is a string representing a 6x3 box.
