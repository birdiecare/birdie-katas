# Social network

## The brief

Your team is tired of all those boring tasks like bowling game scores, bank accounts, singing songs or commanding mars rovers. This time you want to do something truly innovative: A Social Network!

## The Rules

Your team also decided for this project to not only apply TDD and pair-programming - this time you’re gonna use BDD to cover all important features.

### Incremental Kata - no peeping ahead!

This is an incremental kata to simulate a real business situation: work your way through the steps in order, but do not read the next requirement before you have finished your current one.
